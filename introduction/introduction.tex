Space is a growing industry with thousands in orbit currently and, with the introduction of satellite constellations,
thousands more to come in the next decades. In this context automation of is key importance to keeping costs down. 
The attitude determination and control system (ACDS) enables a
satellite to orient itself and is thus critical for operations such as communication
and observation. Due to the inaccessible nature of orbit, ADCS fault-tolerant
control (FTC) is an attractive method of allowing operations to continue after
degradation or even failure of an actuator. Current industry standard methods
of dealing with this problem involve putting the satellite into safe mode and
solving the problem on the ground. This paper proposes to solve this problem
online during operation using a fault detection and isolation unit (FDI) and an
FTC unit â€“ with the focus of being on the FTC unit

Due to the inaccessible nature of space ADCS Fault-tolerant control (FTC) is an attractive method of preventing allowing operations to continue after degradation or
even failure of an actuator.
