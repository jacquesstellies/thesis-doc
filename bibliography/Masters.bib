  abstract = {This paper investigates a learning observer-based fault-tolerant control strategy for a rigid spacecraft attitude system with external disturbance, parameter uncertainty and actuator faults. An adaptive learning observer design approach, which does not require the upper bound information of generalized perturbation, is proposed to estimate the attitude angular velocities and reconstruct actuator faults accurately and quickly. On this basis, a fault tolerant attitude tracking control scheme is developed for spacecraft attitude stabilization by combining the estimation value and backstepping control technique. The stability of the faulty attitude system under the designed fault-tolerant control method is analyzed using Lyapunov framework. Finally, simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Motivated by several accidents, attitude control of a spacecraft subject to faults/failures has gained considerable attention in a wider range of aerospace engineering and academic communities. This paper is concerned with industrial practices and theoretical approaches for fault tolerant control (FTC) and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in spacecraft attitude control system. An overview on recent development of spacecraft attitude FTC system design is presented. The basis of a FTC system is introduced. The existing engineering FTC techniques and theoretical methodologies, including their advantages and disadvantages, are discussed. Moreover, closely associated with the reliability-relevant issues, recent progress in attitude FTC design strategies is reviewed. A brief review of some open problems in the general area of spacecraft attitude control design subject to components faults/failures is further concluded.},
