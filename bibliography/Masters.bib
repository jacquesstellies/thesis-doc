  abstract = {This paper investigates a learning observer-based fault-tolerant control strategy for a rigid spacecraft attitude system with external disturbance, parameter uncertainty and actuator faults. An adaptive learning observer design approach, which does not require the upper bound information of generalized perturbation, is proposed to estimate the attitude angular velocities and reconstruct actuator faults accurately and quickly. On this basis, a fault tolerant attitude tracking control scheme is developed for spacecraft attitude stabilization by combining the estimation value and backstepping control technique. The stability of the faulty attitude system under the designed fault-tolerant control method is analyzed using Lyapunov framework. Finally, simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a robust adaptive fault-tolerant control approach to attitude tracking of flexible spacecraft is proposed for use in situations when there are reaction wheel/actuator failures, persistent bounded disturbances and unknown inertia parameter uncertainties. The controller is designed based on an adaptive backstepping sliding mode control scheme, and a sufficient condition under which this control law can render the system semi-globally input-to-state stable is also provided such that the closed-loop system is robust with respect to any disturbance within a quantifiable restriction on the amplitude, as well as the set of initial conditions, if the control gains are designed appropriately. Moreover, in the design, the control law does not need a fault detection and isolation mechanism even if the failure time instants, patterns and values on actuator failures are also unknown for the designers, as motivated from a practical spacecraft control application. In addition to detailed derivations of the new controller design and a rigorous sketch of all the associated stability and attitude error convergence proofs, illustrative simulation results of an application to flexible spacecraft show that high precise attitude control and vibration suppression are successfully achieved using various scenarios of controlling effective failures.},

  abstract = {This paper designs an active fault-tolerant control system for spacecraft attitude control in the presence of actuator faults, fault estimation errors, and control input constraints. The developed fault-tolerant control system is able to detect the actuator fault without false alarms caused by external disturbances, and also estimate the total fault effects accurately through an indirect fault identification approach, in which an auxiliary variable is utilized to build the relation between fault and system states. Once the fault identification is completed with certain degree of reconstruction accuracy, a fault-tolerant backstepping controller using the nonlinear virtual control input is reconfigured to accommodate the detected actuator faults effectively, in spite of actuator saturation limitations and fault estimation errors. Numerical simulation is carried out to demonstrate that the proposed active fault-tolerant control system is successful in fault detection, identification, and controller reconfiguration for handling actuator faults in attitude control systems.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the velocity-measurement-free feedback control problem associated with attitude tracking for a rigid spacecraft in the presence of both actuator failures and actuator saturation. The decreased reaction torque fault and the increased bias torque fault in the reaction wheel are handled. By using only the measurable attitude, a terminal sliding-mode-based observer is developed to reconstruct all the states of the attitude system in finite time. With the reconstructed information, a novel attitude tracking controller is developed. A Lyapunov analysis shows that the desired attitude trajectories are followed even in the presence of external disturbances. The key features of the proposed control approach are that it is independent from the knowledge of actuator faults and fault-tolerant control is achieved without the need of angular velocity. The attitude tracking performance using the proposed strategy is evaluated through a numerical example.},

This paper is concerned with industrial practices and theoretical approaches for fault tolerant control (FTC) and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in spacecraft attitude control system. An overview on recent development of spacecraft attitude FTC system design is presented. The basis of a FTC system is introduced. The existing engineering FTC techniques and theoretical methodologies, including their advantages and disadvantages, are discussed. Moreover, closely associated with the reliability-relevant issues, recent progress in attitude FTC design strategies is reviewed. A brief review of some open problems in the general area of spacecraft attitude control design subject to components faults/failures is further concluded.},
